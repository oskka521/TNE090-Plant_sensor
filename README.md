By using the Texas Instruments embedded device, CC1310 to autonomously water and monitoring a plant. CC1310 is microcontroller equipped with a Sub-1GHz antenna, which offers more range the conventual 2.4 GHz (Wi-Fi). The Sub 1Ghz wireless transmission offers 1.5-2 times more distance coverage than the 2.4Ghz spectrum and can cover a range of more than 100km if needed2.
Together with Code Composer Studio (CCS) and the CC1310 we utilize preexisting code for transmitting and receiving data. This is then used and modified to fit the applicationâ€™s need.
The sensor in this project should monitor the humidity in the soil and transmit it to a second device, the collector. Then if wanted, the collector be physically connected to a computer which runs a GUI which displays the sensor value (Python based). Also, if the humidity reaches below a fixed value, the sensor should automatically water the plant.
